Many terms in Gen AI are loosy goosy, with no hard definitions, this is my attempt at making a useful dictionary 
## Language Models

### Large Language Model (LLM):
...

### [[Frontier Model]]
A top of the line LLM such as OpenAI's GPT-4o or Llama 3.1 405b.

Anything larger than ~70b parameters

### [[Edge Model]]


~1b parameters to ~70b parameters

Usage Examples
> Introducing the worldâ€™s best edge models... we are proud to introduce two new state-of-the-art models for on-device computing and at-the-edge use cases. We call them les Ministraux: Ministral 3B and Ministral 8B.
> - https://mistral.ai/news/ministraux/

Synonyms
* [[Small Language Model]] ([[SLM]])


### [[Small Language Model]] ([[SLM]])
Compared to a Large Language Model, a SLM typically has fewer parameters, allowing for faster processing and lower memory usage. However, it may not possess the same level of knowledge or context awareness as a Large Language Model due to its smaller size. Small Language Models are often used for specific tasks or applications where resource efficiency is crucial, or as a starting point for research before moving to larger models.

Typically defined as ~1b parameters to ~70b parameters

Usage Examples
> Even though I am quite happy with the new attention gained by Small Language Models, at the same time I feel disappointed.
